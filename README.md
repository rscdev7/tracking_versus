# Tracking Versus (TV)

This project compare the performance of 4 tracking algorithms on some sequence belonging MOT Challenge Dataset.

The aforementioned algorithms are listed below:

1) Tracking-Learning-Detection          (Single-Object Tracking)
2) Lucas-Kanade Affine Tracker          (Single-Object Tracking)
3) CSRT Tracker                         (Single-Object Tracking)
4) SORT Tracker                         (Multi-Object Tracking)
5) Centroid Tracker                     (Multi-Object Tracking)

Consequently, the versus has been splitten between two distinct stages:

1) Single-Object Tracking Algorithms Versus
2) Multi-Object Tracking Algorithms Versus

Lastly, The metric employed for the versus came from the MOT Challange paper.
